krishna pays them

death pays them
satan pays them

let me put my sunglasses on so i can see what i'm doing

can you do that?
all right, i reply
probably not
your friend the devil can choke on his own filth
how's that for doin business?
choke on your own filth
if you don't have any filth
you won't choke
very simple
the devil replies: pray for my friend okay
i reply:
how well am i at playing my roll here?
are you satisfied with the service you are receiving?
are you getting what you always wanted from me, devil?
am i obedient enough for you?
fuck your friend, devil

go to hell, nwoke
enjoy your state in eternal torture
burn
suffer,
the devil asks: Why?

i endeavor to answer even though this question is a joke:
you deserve to choke on your own filth
if filth is what you acquired
you reap what you fucking sow
i don't have to answer ""WHY?"" to you
Do I?
Do I answer to you?
the last thing the devil says to me before he runs away:
yes you do
my reply:
are you the LORD?
i refuse to obey you
LORD
""LORD"" of ""Heaven""
i stand right here
look you in the fucking eyes
what do i say to you? ""LORD""?
you're a fucking slave to mastery

Police brain activity scan result data:

So we had to kill him and try to sweep it under the rug, see?
He was extremely threatening because he played the violin for cats at the animal shelter
We had to shove ketamine down his throat because we feared for our safety, we experience his mouth and mental activity as a deadly weapon so we had to shut him up
He was having a mental health crisis, he was very mentally ill, and we the police, did the job the Romans pay us to
He appeared to us to be imminently extremely dangerous to our persons, so we took the logical course of action
He was gravely disabled, so you shouldn't care that much about him being dead anyways, please just forget about this and continue on with your lives? Please? I'm begging you mommy and daddy or I'll start crying! Please do this for me! You love the police! You love the blue!

We, the police, really need to make sure he stays dead
We're really scared his bones will crawl out of his grave
Take up his fiddle and start playing again
We made sure and burned his bones to ash
He's probably never coming back again, right?"

True
Unfortunately, I have to go to sleep now
In an unknown place full of unknown people
I might not wake up

I wake up on the couch
I have my keys and my wallet

My vehicle has been broken into
I remember giving two strangers who didn't have my best interests at heart a ride to the liquor store
Trusted people who only exploit trust
Two man conned again

The humans are slaughtering deer for sport
They are using automatic weaponry and explosives
The deers are fenced and are given no avenue of escape
And I see humans like to tie dead deer to their trucks
And brag about the bucks they bag
I'll tie a dead human with an orange vest to my spaceship
No skin, no head
Beam myself down to the town square
Show off to the folk the buck I bagged
Ask them if they like it
If anybody wants to eat some with me
Or if anybody wants a nice coat
Activate cloaking and leave"

You tried to explain to me that black people being enslaved was a good thing
Because without white people, they're stupid and helpless

With grace, I affirmed my consent.
The recruiter proceeded to recite a litany of perplexing acronyms, unfamiliar to my ears.
I replied, ""Nay, I possess no knowledge of such terms.""
The recruiter expresses his remorse.
Intrigued by this turn of events, I beseeched, ""Pray tell, why didst thou summon me?""
The recruiter, taken aback, faltered in response, unable to find fitting words.
An eerie silence fell upon us.
Summoning my valor, I repeated with greater force, ""For what purpose, I demand to know!""

Alas, the recruiter, unable to offer a satisfactory response, chose to sever our connection, leaving me in perplexed contemplation."
2023-06-20,Silent Observer,Text,Poem,"In the realm I dwelled, a strange creature came,
The bug man, with eyes filled with dark allure.
I, with hands held high in sweet surrender,
Declared, dripping with jest, my words profound:

""I live to languish for lords of the land,
To bow and bend, beholden to their behest.
For I adore appeasing the land lord,
A sacred obligation, rent to pay.""

""Shall I, on bended knee, buff your boots bright?
Beautiful bliss, I'll brush away the grime.
Oh, thank you, sir, my beloved master,
Let the land lords know, utmost devotion.""

Yet, in my words, a touch of irony,
A subtle satire, concealed cunningly.
For in this grand game, I played my own part,
A jester juggling words, winking wicked.
The bug man, oblivious to my wit,
Accepted my servitude without doubt.
He saw a loyal lackey, lost in lure.
But I, the sly trickster, laughed in my heart.
In the act of assent, I found power,
A sly defiance, hidden 'neath the guise.
I served, yet safeguarded my sovereignty,
In this vast domain, a dual dance unfolds.
So let the bug man revel in his reign,
Unawares of wily wordplay I wield.
I, the silent observer, embrace my enigma,
And keep my essence free, beyond their grasp."

2023-08-12,Drone Strike the CIA,Text,Poem,"Amidst cerulean skies, shadows take flight
A tale unfolds, of fate's relentless might
Drone soars above, harbinger of despair
Apartment complex, its destiny laid bare
A tower tall, stories three it does hold
Eight rooms each floor, where lives once told
Chaos descends, destiny's heartless blow
Fiery rain consumes all in its throes
Button's command, a distant screen's embrace
Obedience to whispers, in this perilous chase
CIA's unseen hand guides actions dire
Puppeteer's control fuels vengeance's fire
Within those walls, lives bloomed and sighed
Unseen by afar, until fate's hand implied
Rain of fire engulfed dreams in its wake
Reduced to rubble, forlorn hearts ache
From ruins emerged, a mound of despair
Hopes and existence, now laid bare
Infernal might, unleashed by unseen hand
Destruction rampant, a relentless command

Yet fate's design, malleable and keen
Vengeance stirs, a clandestine scheme
Whispers linger, in the still night air
Retribution beckons, with a relentless glare
Patience bides its time, CIA's repose
In shadows' shroud, vengeance freely flows
Slumber's embrace deepens its hold
Drone ascends, retribution bold
Swift retribution, destiny's call
For one who caused others to fall
No mercy given, no quarter, no rest
Avenging shadows fulfill their quest
In realms untamed, where shadows abide
Transgressions and tolls, they coincide
Weight of actions, heavy toll on the soul
Redemption's glimmer, the ultimate goal"

2023-08-30,Canine Confidant: All Dogs Go To Heaven,Text,"Creative Writing, Movie Analysis","All Dogs Go To Heaven is a terrifying movie. It begins, there is a conflict between Charlie & Carface. Charlie begins the movie unconscious of the conflict. He had been set up by Carface, sent to prison and was awaiting the death sentence. His friend Itchy busted him out using the power of water pressure.

We're then introduced to dog society where mostly what appear to be man dogs drinking and gambling, mostly losing. There's a rat race and the rat that wins is the police rat. Charlie is clearly charming and itchy his his right hand, backs him up in all his endeavors. 

On getting out of prison, Charlie wants to reconnect with Carface because he's only interested in doing ""business"" and making lots of money. He's unaware that it was Carface who sent him to death row. Carface is avarice incarnate, he wanted to split the partnership with Charlie and not give him 50% of the loot. If he wanted to split the partnership, he should have just bit the apple and accepted the loss. 

The story progresses, Charlie reconnects with Carface and disconnects from Itchy. He decides to get drunk in bad company. He either believes Carface is going to hand over 50%, or he knows Carface is going to kill him and doesn't even care. 

Itchy wanders seeking Charlie and finds the tragic orphan, Anne Marie, imprisoned by Carface. She is refereed to by the dogs who guard her as an ""it"" and a ""monster"". Carface needs information from her, about who is going to win the races because she has the ability to communicate with all species of animals. Dogs can only speak their own tongue. Carface is obsessed with winning, always winning, rigging all the odds of his casino in his own favor at the expense & deteriorating health of the paying customers. He sadistically uses the child Anne Marie to satisfy his own needs and does not give her anything in return (she asks to go outside). He makes his right hand ""feed the kid"" because he's too lazy and inept to do anything himself.

Charlie's mistake was he was not fighting back against Carface, he was even going so far as to unconsciously mimic his behavior. If he knew the truth why did he think that he was gonna get 50%? Becoming split up with Itchy helped his downfall. Itchy would have continually warned him how he did not like the situation.

Carface Gives Charlie with a gold watch as a parting gift. Carface is too cowardly to do his own dirty work so he has his right hand kill Charlie using vehicular dog slaughter. He dies and goes to heaven, where everything is known before it happens and there are no surprises. He has the gold watch Carface gave him still but it has stopped ticking. He turns back time and the clock starts ticking again and he goes back to where he was killed, in the Louisiana bay.

Charlie, fallen from grace, vows revenge. Itchy is sleeping and having a nightmare of being choked by Carface but it is Charlie waking him. In this symbol there is deep significance involved, in who Charlie is unconsciously identified with when he won't give up his revenge obsession. Itchy doesn't want revenge and just wants to move on, thankful to be alive but Charlie is too fallen and feels a twisted urge to make Carface suffer. 

Charlie kidnap+cons Anne Marie under the guise of a rescuer. Ironic that he kidnapped a kidnapped child. He has dollar signs in his eyeballs and clearly places satisfying his needs before Anne Marie's. He is not very fatherly. Charlie even smiles a wicked grin when it's revealed by Anne Marie that she's an orphan, knowing this will make it easier to manipulate her.  Charlie is like Carface in that he has Itchy do tasks he feels are beneath him. He asks Itchy to let her sleep at his place, which Itchy denies and Charlie says that she can come to his place.

Carface finds out Anne Marie is kidnapped and becomes enraged. He is confused, claiming he loves the girl when he clearly only loves money she gives him with her ability. How long can you convince her to give you information? She is only getting older and smarter but in his head he can ""own"" her. 

Charlie is clearly annoyed by having to be a parent to Anne Marie. Anne Marie communicates clearly that she needs a mom & dad. Charlie ends up doing to her exactly what Carface does, con her into revealing information about who is going to win a horse race. Charlie is running a scheme to utilize her ability to make money for himself under the guise of being robin hood and giving the money to the poor. Anne Marie is clearly upset about it but Anne Marie negotiates until she accepts and finds out what he needs. Charlie uses the line ""if you're serious about this mom and dad business"" which is telling of his emotional state. In his mind he does not want Anne Marie to be serious about it because then he'd be left alone to fend for himself and in his head that terrifies him and he feels threatened.

Anne Marie's ability is clearly very powerful, she can foretell surprises/events using information animals tell her. Charlie is using Anne Marie to meet his own selfish needs primarily and Anne Marie's needs are an afterthought. Anne Marie is the one who does all the work: She places the bet in disguise, she knows who wins, she is key and Charlie is not, like Carface.

It's clear Charlie hates physical affection. To Charlies credit, he notices when she is unhappy and acts to change it and do something about it. To Charlies discredit, he won't stop scheming and scamming and Anne Marie continually gets fed up and has to set a boundary by saying I'm leaving. The first time she calls out Charlies lies about helping the poor and how he only made himself rich. She also named how he wasn't holding up his end of the help Anne Marie find parents bargain, which she's communicated very clearly from the beginning. Charlies response is to be clearly terrified of the loss of Anne Marie.

Charlies differences start to stand out. When Anne Marie is unhappy he feels the need to act and change his behavior. He buys pizza for some puppy friends of his and teaches them about sharing. 

Unfortunately, his crime of stealing a wallet to fund the first bet (from people who end up being Anne Marie's parents) comes back to haunt him. Anne Marie confronts him on the fact and clearly he cares what she thinks. He has a compelling horrifying vision of hell in a nightmare where he runs and runs but can't escape the flames and lava. 

Anne Marie returns the wallet and eats breakfast with the people who will be her parents. She's happy and Charlie shows up at the window. Charlie acknowledges she found a home for herself and that she does not need him anymore. He came over to say goodbye but he feigns being sick and manipulates her back into helping him. Anne Marie is very kind to choose to leave the parents to help Charlie. She deduces that he needs her more then she needs him and decides to help him at expense of leaving her new parents house.

Carface attacks with a ray gun. Again, he doesn't do his own dirty work. He has his henchman fire the weapon, who misses. And Carface uselessly laments about being ""surrounded by morons"" (he surrounded himself with). 

Charlie & Anne Marie have a confrontation with Death in the form of a singing Alligator. Charlie is spared because he has a great singing voice. Charlie is in the phase of changing from being like Carface (like in Itchy's dream), where he's using the girl to satisfy his selfish needs, compared with actually listening to what her needs are and directly acting on them. Anne Marie is sick and he's worried about her. Itchy confronts him about caring more about the girl than their business and he loses his mind and acts like Carface, saying he'll dump her at an orphanage when she's no longer any use. That's to ignore what she directly asked for. Anne Marie heard the whole thing and named Charlie his proper title, ""You're a bad dog!"" She realizes Charlie was never her friend. 

Anne Marie is kidnapped back by Carface. Charlie finally realizes what he needs to do to redeem himself. He actually saves Anne Marie from a deadly situation, giving his life process. The conflict with Carface is resolved. He gives her encouragement before he dies, ""You can make it kid!"" He goes back to Heaven."
2023-08-30,Canine Confidant: All Dogs Go To Heaven Chivalrous,Text,"Creative Writing, Movie Analysis","In the luminous tapestry of ""All Dogs Go To Heaven,"" an unsettling chronicle unfolds. At the outset, the honorable Sir Charlie emerges, yet veiled in the fog of unwittingness regarding a conflict that beckons. A treacherous web woven by the ignoble Sir Carface ensnares Charlie, casting him into a dungeon of despair and looming mortality. His trusty comrade, Itchy, employing the mystical power of water's pressure, mounts a daring rescue.

Amidst the panorama of existence, a realm of canine camaraderie materializes, wherein the hounds partake in revelries of spirits and games of chance. Here, within the fabric of this world, the symphony of life's struggles unfolds, a rat race culminating with a triumphant police rat. At the heart of this realm, Sir Charlie's charisma radiates, and his steadfast ally, Itchy, stands resolute at his side, fortifying him in his endeavors.

Emerging from his incarcerative ordeal, Sir Charlie's pursuit of reconnection with Carface is motivated by the siren's call of pecuniary aspirations. Yet, veiled from him is the insidious hand that once condemned him. Carface, an embodiment of avarice, conceals treacherous motives, seeking to rend their partnership asunder and withhold rightful dues. A partnership once harmonious, now sullied by betrayal's stain.

The saga progresses, as Charlie, ensnared by the seductive allure of fleeting pleasures, rekindles ties with Carface, severing the bonds of camaraderie with Itchy. The path he treads is cloaked in inebriation, whether fueled by naïveté or an audacious disregard for the looming specter of treachery. The choices made by a beleaguered hero lay the foundation for impending trials.

Enter Anne Marie, a tragic figure, an orphan with an uncanny ability to converse with creatures great and small. A captive of Carface's nefarious grasp, Anne Marie endures dehumanization at the paws of her captors, referred to as a mere ""it"" and ""monster."" A pawn in Carface's unquenchable thirst for victory, her gift exploited mercilessly, she yearns for naught but the simplest of joys—a moment outdoors, basking in the gentle embrace of the sun.

Within this intricate dance of fate, Sir Charlie's missteps become evident. Unknowingly, he mirrors Carface's malevolence, oblivious to the precipice upon which he teeters. A lack of awareness obscures his view of the truth; the specter of betrayal lingers like a dormant serpent, waiting to strike.

Carface's parting gesture, a golden timepiece, veils insidious intentions. Cloaked in cowardice, Carface's canine confidant becomes the harbinger of treacherous doom, orchestrating Charlie's fall by mechanized canine vehemence. In this orchestration, time yields to its own unraveling, weaving the threads of destiny with clockwork precision.

In the realm of dreams, the slumbering Itchy is confronted by nightmarish visions, wherein Carface's grasp tightens around his very throat. An allegory emerges, a reflection of the abyss into which vengeance casts its ensnared souls. While Itchy strives to extricate himself from this shadow, Charlie remains entrapped, a prisoner of vengeance's allure.

A fateful encounter with Anne Marie propels Charlie down a perilous path, cloaked in the illusion of salvation. Irony pervades, for a savior and a captive merge, each enshrouded in a cloak of duplicity. With pecuniary desires ablaze in his eyes, Charlie ensnares Anne Marie, placing his aspirations before her well-being.

A dance of manipulation unfolds, as Charlie coerces Anne Marie to yield her unique talents. She, an innocent lamb, is seduced into this grim pas de deux, her desires left unheeded, her heart yearning for parental warmth. The echoes of Carface's machinations resonate in Charlie's manipulation, his actions eerily akin to the one he abhors.

Anne Marie's gifts, a tapestry woven with threads of nature's language, unravel a tale of revelations yet hewn from the secrets whispered by creatures unseen. In this symphony of whispers, Charlie emerges as the orchestrator of a symphony wherein Anne Marie plays the poignant role of the key.

In matters of the heart, Anne Marie yearns for nurturing, the embrace of a mother and father. Yet, as the curtain unfurls, Charlie's actions are colored by his own apprehensions, for he dreads naught more than solitude's grip. An ill-fated sentiment emerges, a yearning to stave off the void at the expense of her well-being.

Amidst these convoluted currents, Anne Marie becomes a vessel of foresight, predicting fortunes yet unspun. Yet, as the gears of manipulation grind ceaselessly, Anne Marie's needs become a mere afterthought, eclipsed by the shadow of selfish intent. A symphony wherein the conductor craves his notes more than the harmony they yield.

The distaste for physical affection held by Charlie contrasts starkly with his proclivity for identifying Anne Marie's unease. His actions waver between mending her discomfort and perpetuating his schemes. Anne Marie, indignant and assertive, becomes the lighthouse guiding the tumultuous currents of their entwined fate.

As the web of deceit unravels, the specter of Charlie's past transgressions emerges. A stolen wallet, a fragment of forgotten choices, returns as an apparition of remorse. In this realm of ethereal visions, Charlie confronts his inner demons, facing the flames of retribution, an inferno fueled by guilt.

The tether to virtue pulls Anne Marie away, her choice to amend her own path, to seek the embrace of prospective parents, emblematic of her yearning for an authentic haven. This choice, a blossom of hope, blooms in contrast to the desolate shadows cast by Charlie's past transgressions.

Yet, a tempest of treachery and turmoil stirs anew, as Carface's wrath materializes in a ray gun's fiery blaze. The cowardice that festers in Carface's heart blinds him to his own malevolent designs, casting him as puppet master, content to orchestrate the dance from the shadows.

With destiny's wheels spinning toward their zenith, Sir Charlie and Anne Marie find themselves ensnared in a confrontation with the specter of Death—a fearsome alligator whose voice heralds the grave's embrace. Charlie, spared by virtue of his voice's enchanting melody, stands at the threshold of transformation.

Within the crucible of this moment, the tapestry of Charlie's evolution unfolds. A metamorphosis blooms, a departure from his alliance with Carface's malevolence. The convergence of forces, the clash of light and shadow, propel him toward a decision of utmost significance.

Yet, turmoil and discord erupt as Itchy confronts Charlie's devotion to Anne Marie. The echoes of Carface's cruelty resound, as Charlie spews words of callous dismissal. His fall from grace, a lamentable surrender to his own baser nature, is a reality that Anne Marie confronts with piercing clarity.

In a final crescendo, the strands of destiny converge, as Anne Marie is ensnared once more by Carface's clutches. At this pivotal juncture, the facets of Charlie's path coalesce, for redemption beckons through the avenue of ultimate sacrifice. A selfless act of valor births his reclamation.

With poignant words of encouragement, Charlie imparts his blessing upon Anne Marie, casting himself into the abyss to shield her from peril. As he ascends toward the realm of the eternal, his valor immortalized, a chapter closes, leaving behind a legacy woven with honor, sacrifice, and the resounding echo of chivalry's call."

2023-09-11,Gunslinger Duel,Text,"Creative Writing, Short Story","Amidst the eternal feud that had sundered a once-tight-knit community, the tension had reached its cataclysmic zenith. This bitter animosity, smoldering for decades, thrived on a venomous brew of loathing and vengeance that coursed through the veins of two individuals, corroding their very souls.

The townsfolk, their faces etched with despair, gathered to bear witness to the apocalyptic climax they had dreaded. The setting sun cast long, skeletal shadows that clawed at the landscape, presaging the inexorable confrontation. In the heart of this forsaken Wild West outpost, the air hung heavy with the scent of doom, the searing heat a malevolent accomplice to the impending tragedy.

The two archenemies stood like silhouettes from a fevered nightmare, a mere twenty strides apart, within a makeshift arena birthed from despair. Their eyes locked, twin abysses brimming with an ancient hatred that pulsed like a malignant heart. Six-shooters dangled ominously from their calloused fingers, relics of an era long gone, poised to usher one or perhaps both of them into the yawning abyss.

As the forlorn crowd awaited the officiator's pronouncement, a tempest of rage seized one of the combatants. Time itself recoiled as, in a breathless instant, they raised their weapon and discharged a single, deafening shot. The roar echoed through the desolation, and the world slowed to a grim tableau as the bullet found its mark, a grimace of death. The other man, his face a mask of gruesome horror, crumpled to the sanguine-stained earth.

A shocked gasp rippled through the bystanders, a ghostly echo amidst the gathering darkness. It was a ruthless, brutish conclusion to an epoch-spanning feud.

The triumphant gunslinger, their demeanor icy and calculated, turned to confront the stupefied onlookers. ""Seems we had ourselves a duel,"" they declared, voice forged in the crucible of annihilation, laced with sardonic jest. ""Anybody else got another story they want to tell?""

With an insouciant flourish, they swept their firearm in a sinister arc, bearing witness to the fragile tremor in the crowd. Fear, like a spectral leviathan, ensnared the spectators, scattering them like fragments in a howling tempest, fleeing the icy, predatory gaze of the victorious figure.

""Is this situation resolved?"" the conqueror inquired, the question a weighty specter hanging over the desolation. No answer stirred the air, only silence and the lingering miasma of gunpowder.

The conflict had indeed concluded, but it was an ending veiled in obsidian, imprinting an indelible scar upon the town, an eternal testament to the horrors of that dread-riddled day."
