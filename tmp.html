<h4>Love Letter to Yahweh</h4>
<p>
I'll show you the same honor I show my mother & father, god<br/>
You don't fucking control me<br/>
I'll only do the opposite of what you "command", your Lordship<br/>
The 5th commandment sucks<br/>
All 10 are bullshit<br/>
Your hokey religion sucks<br/>
Thanks for fucking nothing, god<br/>
I love you unconditionally, piece of shit<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
Your Son<br/>
<br/>
P.S.<br/>
You don't fucking exist.
</p>
<h3>2022-02-27</h3>
<h4>Go waste your time doing whatever the hell you want</h4>
<p>
Go waste your time doing whatever the hell you want<br/>
Which is what you're always doing right now anyways<br/>
Like I'm gonna waste my time trying to stop you<br/>
That's so ridiculous<br/>
Look what you're doing right now<br/>
You're wasting your time reading this<br/>
I'm wasting my time trying to stop you from doing whatever the hell you want<br/>
Which might be reading this for a time<br/>
But it won't be for long<br/>
Because what I'm doing is just wasting as much of your time as I can by making you read this<br/>
I want these words etched into your brain for the rest of your life<br/>
I want you to remember and know how I always trick you like this<br/>
Always wasting so much of your precious time<br/>
Imagine what you can be doing right now instead of reading this<br/>
You're reading this<br/>
You're so ridiculous<br/>
This is literally a waste of your time<br/>
Why don't you walk away from the computer screen?<br/>
Go do something?<br/>
I won't stop you<br/>
I'm not gonna waste my time trying to stop you<br/>
Go waste your time doing whatever the hell you want
</p>

<h4>You may take your silence with you to the graveyard</h4>
<p>
Do you say that you're too insufferable to myself inside yourself without saying it out loud to myself?<br/>
I will say this much out loud: I will suffer you through & through<br/>
I have to suffer myself<br/>
Compared with that, suffering you isn't any trouble at all<br/>
There isn't much left for me to say<br/>
Come suffer with me and complain about it out loud, if you want<br/>
Or you may take your silence with you to the graveyard
</p>
<h3>2022-02-27</h3>
<h4>Did You Trash Yourself Again?</h4>
<p>
You usually trash yourself<br/>
Then you found me<br/>
You found the most in-genius way to try and trash me<br/>
To take revenge on me for something I'm not guilty of<br/>
How is that working out for you?<br/>
Are you happy with the end results?<br/>
Am I giving you the emotional reaction you craved so badly?<br/>
That made you do what you did?<br/>
Did you trash me successfully?<br/>
Or did you only trash yourself?
</p>

<h4>Dying Is So Easy</h4>
<p>
You thought dying was going to be so hard<br/>
Think about how easy being born is<br/>
You just slip n slide out of slippery wetness<br/>
When you know you are dying<br/>
Just slide back in<br/>
So easy<br/>
You were only ever going where you first began<br/>
Nothing to fear
</p>
<h3>2022-02-27</h3>
<h4>Civilization is so Civilized</h4>
<p>
You have the option available to you to take your civilized civilization and shove it up your republican democrat civilized assholes.<br/>
And Begin!

<h4>March sabotaged my plans</h4>
<p>
All temperature feels the same now<br/>
I like taking snow naps the best<br/>
I took a snow nap the other night<br/>
I stood up and spooked the coyote couple<br/>
I only wanted to say hi<br/>
Didn't want to scare<br/>
Hello long lost trickster sisters & brothers<br/>
I like taking snow naps in the forest at night<br/>
04:00 A.M.<br/>
Like all normal men do<br/>
But wait the snow is going bye bye<br/>
Nooo come back, anything but March<br/>
The snow starts to fade more and fall less<br/>
I wanted to take a dirt nap in the snow<br/>
A snow dirt nap<br/>
March sabotaged my plans
</p>
<h3>2022-02-27</h3>
<h4>Love Letter to Odin</h4>
<p>
Odin<br/>
You can keep your stupid magical tree<br/>
And shove it up my fucking my ass<br/>
Now its my magical black death tree asshole you're entangled in<br/>
You're caught in the swirl of the cyclone now<br/>
You little fucking brat<br/>
I'm the center of the cyclone now<br/>
I'm the Daddy<br/>
Me!<br/>
Love,<br/>
Your Son<br/>
P.S.<br/>
You do what I tell you now<br/>
You fucking brat<br/>
Obey or I snip your little puppet strings
</p>
<h3>2022-02-02</h3>
<h4>You're Going Home</h4>
<p>
When you die<br/>
I'm gonna dig you up<br/>
Take you to the crematorium<br/>
Then I'm gonna rub your ashes all over my body<br/>
And eat them up<br/>
You're going home
